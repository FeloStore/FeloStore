## About

The Google Play Store is the de-facto app store in the Android ecosystem.
However, many users are unsatisfied with some of its practices and policies such
as mandatory Play App Signing for new apps and the need for a Google account to
use the store. These users often turn to F-Droid, which fails to adhere to the
Android security model and provide timely and secure app updates from a
repository with strict minimum security requirements.

Accrescent aims to provide an accessible app store with modern security features
and strict minimum requirements for apps in its repository.
